# Case study - Datacamp Professional Certificate

In this pratical exam, I must act as a Data Analyst and perform an analysis for "Pens and Printers" based on the on the email below. It is expected a Written Report and a video presentation up to 10 minutes long.

Business Task
Hi, Really hoping you could help me out with some analysis. This is quite short notice but I have a meeting with the executive team to update them on sales approaches for the new product line so I need this information as soon as possible.

We need to know:

How many customers were there for each approach?
What does the spread of the revenue look like overall? And for each method?
Was there any difference in revenue over time for each of the methods?
Based on the data, which method would you recommend we continue to use? Some of these methods take more time from the team so they may not be the best for us to use if the results are similar. We don’t really know if there are other differences between the customers in each group, so anything you can tell us would be really helpful to give some context to what went well.

Written Report
Your written report should include written text summaries and graphics of the following:
### Data validation:
Describe validation and cleaning steps for every column in the data
### Exploratory Analysis to answer the customer questions ensuring you include:
Two different types of graphic showing single variables only
At least one graphic showing two or more variables
Description of your findings
### Definition of a metric for the business to monitor
How should the business monitor what they want to achieve?
Estimate the initial value(s) for the metric based on the current data?
### Final summary including recommendations that the business should undertake

Presentation
You will give an overview presentation to the sales rep who requested the work. The
presentation should include:
● An overview of the project and business goals
● A summary of the work you undertook and how this addresses the problem
